## Part 1 - Summary of IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS


**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**

Infrastructure as a Service, sometimes abbreviated as IaaS, contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provide access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. Infrastructure as a Service provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources and is most similar to existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today.


**Platform as a Service (PaaS)**

Platforms as a service remove the need for organizations to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allow you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.


**Software as a Service (SaaS)**

Software as a Service provides you with a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, people referring to Software as a Service are referring to end-user applications. With a SaaS offering you do not have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed; you only need to think about how you will use that particular piece of software. A common example of a SaaS application is web-based email where you can send and receive email without having to manage feature additions to the email product or maintaining the servers and operating systems that the email program is running on.

One of Amazon Web Services, known as IaaS or Infrastructure as a Service, focuses on offering infrastructure services based on cloud computing technology. It's easy to think of a company that offers IaaS, but among the top providers globally, AWS stands out as the leader in IaaS cloud services. It has customers in 190 nations and 66 accessible Zones spread across 21 geographical regions. IaaS Amazon Service is used to replace physical resources, such as servers, with virtual resources hosted and managed by Amazon. On these leased servers, system users are free to use any operating system or application without paying additional maintenance or operation costs.


AWS IaaS helps businesses to digitize more quickly while allowing them to integrate all their data on a single platform. Additionally, it enables businesses to scale up and down at any given time to suit their needs. All these features make AWS IaaS a widely-used platform by companies nowadays. Magento can be considered a typical example of IaaS in AWS.

### AWS IaaS Benefits

- Availability of separate development environment 
- Hardware and operating system specifications for the service can be selected and used directly from the network
- Allow expanding the resources of the server in terms of quantity and functionality
- No errors or extra costs arise while upgrading the system


### AWS IaaS Characteristics

- Resources are available as a service
- Cost depends on the consumption
- Highly scalable
- Allow multiple users to access a single piece of hardware
- The organization has complete control of the infrastructure
- Dynamic and flexible


### When to use Amazon AWS IaaS

- Startups and small companies which want to avoid spending time and money in producing hardware and software.
- Larger companies which prefer complete control over their applications and infrastructure, but want to purchase only what is needed for the app development.
- Companies with rapid growth potential that like to keep altering hardware and software as per their demands for scaling up.


### AWS IaaS services Drawbacks 

- Security threats which may arise from the host or other virtual machines
- Customers’ inability to access their data when vendor outages happen
