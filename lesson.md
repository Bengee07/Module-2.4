**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**

Infrastructure as a Service, sometimes abbreviated as IaaS, contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provide access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. Infrastructure as a Service provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources and is most similar to existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today.


**Platform as a Service (PaaS)**

Platforms as a service remove the need for organizations to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allow you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.


**Software as a Service (SaaS)**

Software as a Service provides you with a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, people referring to Software as a Service are referring to end-user applications. With a SaaS offering you do not have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed; you only need to think about how you will use that particular piece of software. A common example of a SaaS application is web-based email where you can send and receive email without having to manage feature additions to the email product or maintaining the servers and operating systems that the email program is running on.

One of Amazon Web Services, known as IaaS or Infrastructure as a Service, focuses on offering infrastructure services based on cloud computing technology. It's easy to think of a company that offers IaaS, but among the top providers globally, AWS stands out as the leader in IaaS cloud services. It has customers in 190 nations and 66 accessible Zones spread across 21 geographical regions. IaaS Amazon Service is used to replace physical resources, such as servers, with virtual resources hosted and managed by Amazon. On these leased servers, system users are free to use any operating system or application without paying additional maintenance or operation costs.


AWS IaaS helps businesses to digitize more quickly while allowing them to integrate all their data on a single platform. Additionally, it enables businesses to scale up and down at any given time to suit their needs. All these features make AWS IaaS a widely-used platform by companies nowadays. Magento can be considered a typical example of IaaS in AWS.

### AWS IaaS Benefits

- Availability of separate development environment 
- Hardware and operating system specifications for the service can be selected and used directly from the network
- Allow expanding the resources of the server in terms of quantity and functionality
- No errors or extra costs arise while upgrading the system


### AWS IaaS Characteristics

- Resources are available as a service
- Cost depends on the consumption
- Highly scalable

This service gives programmers the building blocks they need to create apps. In its most basic form, a third-party vendor will give users hardware and software tools over the Internet, leaving users only responsible for the design and development of applications. The PaaS service provider will host all hardware and software on its own network.

### PaaS benefit

- Availability of application development environment which saves users a lot of time and money.
- Users don’t need to worry about platform maintenance and backup services which are entirely managed by cloud technology.
- The infrastructure is stored directly in the cloud, and users can always access it immediately.
- Save time developing applications thanks to existing cross-platform environments.
- Flexible development according to users’ need of using advanced software.


### PaaS Characteristics

Consider the below characteristics will help you determine when PaaS is being utilized:

- Resources can easily be scaled up or down as your business changes.
- Provides a variety of services to facilitate the development, testing, and deployment of apps.
- Multiple users can access via the same development application.
- Able to integrate with web services and databases.


### When to Use PaaS

PaaS is a great option if you're looking for a time- and money-saving solution. By managing software updates and security patches for the developer, PaaS frees up more time to focus on the creative aspects of app development, such as designing, testing, and deploying the app.


### AWS PaaS Drawbacks 

- Dependent on the provider’s functional capabilities, speed, and reliability.
- Compatibility problems may arise when existing infrastructure is incorporated into a new environment.
- Security risks due to its availability in the public environment.


## Part 4 - SaaS (Software as a service)

**Applications**

- IaaS: Applications are managed by the users, and IaaS enables all the needed infrastructure to operate large scale web applications.
- PaaS: Applications are managed by the users, and PaaS tools are often used to develop mobile applications.
- SaaS: Applications are managed by the service provider, and they are also called web-based software or on-demand software. They are run on the SaaS provider’s servers, where the provider is in charge of the access to the applications, their security, availability, and performance.

**Data**
- IaaS: The data is managed by the user, and the IaaS infrastructure enables businesses to eliminate the costs of having and maintaining their own physical servers. Also, IaaS data centers are more scalable compared to traditional data centers.
- PaaS: The data is managed by the user, and it is cheaper to do it compared to IaaS. It also has built-in scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance.
- SaaS: The data is managed by the provider, and SaaS can handle and efficiently manage large volumes of data. SaaS enables users to access their data from any device. All you need is access to a web browser and an Internet connection.

**Runtime**
- IaaS: Runtime is managed by the user, and companies that use IaaS pay for it by the hour for compute environments, regardless of whether they are being used or not.
- PaaS: Runtime is managed by the service provider, and the runtime on PaaS limits users to a specific application framework.
- SaaS: Runtime is managed by the service provider, and it comes as a part of the full-fledged product that SaaS offers to its users.

**Middleware**
- IaaS: Middleware is managed by the user, and it is a software that lies between the OS and the applications that run on it.
- PaaS: Middleware is managed by the service provider, so users don’t have to bother with anything related to it.
- SaaS: Middleware is managed by the service provider, and it improves the flexibility of multi-tenant SaaS applications because it provides tenant-specific customizations.

**Operating System**
- IaaS: The OS is managed by the user.
- PaaS: The OS is managed by the service provider.
- SaaS: The OS is managed by the service provider.

**Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking**
- IaaS: All is handled by the service provider, and users can rest assured that all is up running without having to do anything.
